# C# Windows Forms Game Launcher for Old Game Project

This is a [SharpDevelop](https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop) Project that I found on a old laptop. 

It included sound playback, options (with file writing), and the ability to change what program was to be run through command line.

The song is [Gardens by Soba](https://soundcloud.com/sobasoba/gardens) and the default background image is: ![](https://i.imgur.com/F7GGSXw.jpeg)
